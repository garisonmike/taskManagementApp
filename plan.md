## Issue 9.4 — Prevent Duplicate Tasks from Blueprint Generation
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ Generating from blueprint multiple times does not duplicate tasks
- ✅ Unsure tasks cannot duplicate
- ✅ Time‑based/deadline tasks may duplicate only if time differs

**Completion Notes**
- **Implemented comprehensive deduplication logic in _generateTasksFromBlueprint()**
- Added pre-generation check: Fetches all existing tasks before generating new ones
- Smart duplicate detection based on task type:

- **Unsure tasks deduplication**
- Checks: title (case-insensitive) + task type
- If both match an existing task, skips generation
- Prevents multiple identical unsure tasks from accumulating

- **Deadline tasks deduplication**
- Checks: title (case-insensitive) + task type + deadline date & time
- Only creates if deadline time differs (year, month, day, hour, minute comparison)
- Allows same task at different deadlines (e.g., "Submit report" at 9 AM and 5 PM)

- **Time-based tasks deduplication**
- Checks: title (case-insensitive) + task type + start time
- Only creates if start time differs (year, month, day, hour, minute comparison)
- Allows same task at different time slots (e.g., "Gym" at 6 AM and 6 PM)

- **User feedback improvements**
- Tracks both generated and skipped counts
- Enhanced SnackBar message: "Generated X task(s), skipped Y duplicate(s)"
- Clear communication when duplicates are found
- Original message shown when no duplicates: "Generated X task(s) from blueprint"

- **Blueprint generation workflow**
- User clicks "Generate Tasks" on blueprint
- System checks all existing tasks for duplicates
- Creates only non-duplicate tasks
- Shows summary of generation results
- Refreshes task list to show new tasks

- All 111 tests passing
- Zero flutter analyze issues
- Generating from same blueprint multiple times now safely skips duplicates
- Unsure tasks correctly blocked from duplication
- Deadline/time-based tasks allow duplicates only when times differ
- Clean and efficient deduplication algorithm with O(n*m) complexity where n=blueprint tasks, m=existing tasks

**Completed:** ✅

## Issue 9.3 — Fix Blueprint Task Persistence
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ Newly added blueprint tasks persist
- ✅ UI reflects updates immediately
- ✅ No disappearing tasks after save

**Completion Notes**
- **Fixed blueprint task persistence in BlueprintInputPage**
- Root cause: New tasks added to existing blueprints had empty `blueprintId` ('')
- When saving, code checked if task exists in DB, but didn't set correct `blueprintId` for new tasks

- **Improved _saveBlueprint() logic**
- Added pre-save tracking: Fetches existing task IDs from database when editing blueprint
- Ensures correct `blueprintId`: Checks if task has empty `blueprintId` and sets it to `blueprint.id` before save
- Proper deletion handling: Compares existing tasks vs current task list, deletes removed tasks
- Smart create/update: Uses `existingTaskIds` to determine whether to create or update each task
- Eliminates redundant database queries: Single query to get existing tasks instead of checking each task individually

- **Simplified _deleteTask() method**
- Changed from immediate database deletion to deferred deletion (only removes from UI state)
- Actual database deletion happens during save when comparing task lists
- Prevents orphaned deletions and ensures atomic save operation
- Cleaner user experience: All changes (add/edit/delete tasks) applied together on Save

- **Task workflow improvements**
- Add task: Creates task with empty `blueprintId`, gets corrected on save
- Edit task: Uses `copyWith` to preserve existing `blueprintId`
- Delete task: Removes from `_tasks` list, database deletion handled on save
- Cancel: No database changes occur, clean rollback

- All 111 tests passing
- Zero flutter analyze issues
- Newly added tasks now persist correctly with proper `blueprintId`
- UI immediately reflects all changes after save
- No task disappearance issues
- Blueprint task management is now robust and atomic

**Completed:** ✅

## Issue 9.2 — Fix Task Completion & Failure Crash
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ Completing a task does not crash
- ✅ Failing a task does not crash
- ✅ Failure reason optional
- ✅ UI updates immediately

**Completion Notes**
- **Fixed `_dependents.isEmpty` assertion crash**
- Added `mounted` checks in TaskNotifier before all state updates
- Protected `loadTasks()` - checks mounted before setting loading/data/error states (lines 27-37)
- Protected `addTask()` - checks mounted before refreshing list after creation (line 46)
- Protected `updateTask()` - checks mounted before refreshing list after update (line 84)
- Protected `deleteTask()` - checks mounted before refreshing list after deletion (line 96)
- Prevents state updates after StateNotifier disposal (e.g., when user navigates away during async operation)
- All 111 tests passing
- Zero flutter analyze issues
- Tasks can be completed successfully without crashes
- Tasks can be marked as failed with optional reason without crashes
- UI updates properly after task status changes

**Completed:** ✅

## Issue 9.1 — Fix Task Deletion & Multi‑Select Actions
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ Single task delete works
- ✅ Multi‑select delete works
- ✅ Multi‑select complete works
- ✅ Clear selection UI state

**Completion Notes**
- **Created selection state management system**
- Added `SelectionStateNotifier` and `selectionStateProvider` to track selected task IDs and selection mode
- Selection state includes: `selectedTaskIds` (Set), `isSelectionMode` (bool), `selectedCount` (int)
- Provides methods: `toggleSelectionMode()`, `toggleTaskSelection()`, `selectAll()`, `clearSelection()`, `exitSelectionMode()`

- **Implemented bulk operations in TaskNotifier**
- Added `bulkDeleteTasks(List<String> taskIds)` - deletes multiple tasks with logging
- Added `bulkCompleteTasks(List<String> taskIds)` - marks multiple tasks as completed with logging
- Both methods include proper mounted checks and error handling

- **Enhanced TasksPage UI with multi-select mode**
- Added checklist icon in app bar to toggle selection mode
- Selection mode AppBar shows: selection count, close button, and "select all" button
- Tasks display checkboxes when in selection mode instead of regular leading icons
- Disabled task actions menu and completion button in selection mode
- Task tap in selection mode toggles selection instead of opening edit page

- **Created BulkActionBar widget**
- Appears at bottom when tasks are selected (only in selection mode)
- Two primary actions: Complete (green) and Delete (red)
- Complete button: Confirmation dialog → marks all selected tasks as completed → exits selection mode → shows success snackbar
- Delete button: Confirmation dialog with warning → deletes all selected tasks → exits selection mode → shows success snackbar
- Material design with primary container background and shadow

- **User experience improvements**
- Visual feedback: Selected tasks are highlighted with ListTile's selected property
- Clear workflows: Exiting selection mode clears all selections automatically
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental bulk operations
- Success feedback via SnackBar messages
- Select all button for quick bulk selection

- All 111 tests passing
- Zero flutter analyze issues
- Single task delete works (existing functionality preserved)
- Multi-select delete works with confirmation
- Multi-select complete works with confirmation
- Selection state properly cleared when exiting selection mode

**Completed:** ✅
