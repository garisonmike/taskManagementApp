# Task Management App

**Version 1.1.0** — An offline-first Android task management application built with Flutter.

## What's New in v1.1.0

This release focuses on **stability and user experience improvements**:

### Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed crashes when loading blueprints without meals
- ✅ Fixed crashes on days with no tasks or meals
- ✅ Fixed task completion toggle not persisting
- ✅ Fixed heatmap calendar crashes on empty months
- ✅ Fixed app startup crashes
- ✅ Fixed blueprint CRUD operation crashes
- ✅ Fixed search functionality crashes

### UX Improvements
- 🎨 Enhanced splash screen with random images and no-repeat logic
- 📊 Repositioned heatmap below task list for better hierarchy
- 🔍 Implemented real-time search with instant filtering
- 💡 Added tap-to-view-details on heatmap for month/day/task breakdown
- ⏱️ Consistent 1.5s splash screen timing
- 🏷️ Updated navigation labels for clarity

### Architecture Layers

#### 1. **Presentation Layer** (`presentation/`)
- Contains all UI components (pages, widgets)
- Manages state using **Riverpod** (StateNotifier/AsyncNotifier)
- Uses feature-scoped providers
- Immutable state only
- No business logic in widgets (delegated to use cases)
- Interacts with domain layer through use cases
- **Dependency**: Domain layer only

#### 2. **Domain Layer** (`domain/`)
- Core business logic and entities
- Repository interfaces (contracts)
- Use cases (application-specific business rules)
- **Dependency**: None (completely independent)

#### 3. **Data Layer** (`data/`)
- Repository implementations
- Data models with serialization/deserialization
- Data sources (local database, shared preferences)
- **Dependency**: Domain layer only

#### 4. **Core Layer** (`core/`)
- Shared utilities and constants
- Theme configuration
- Error handling
- **Dependency**: None (used by all layers)

### Design Principles

1. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward (Presentation → Domain ← Data)
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single, well-defined responsibility
3. **Testability**: Business logic is isolated and easily testable
4. **Offline-First**: All data operations work offline by default
5. **Immutability**: Entities and models are immutable where possible
